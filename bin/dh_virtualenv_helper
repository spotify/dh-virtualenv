'''
Generates debian/ directory with boilerplate contents for dh-virtualenv.

Intended to ease this kind of packaging of typical Python-only libraries or
tools.

Monkey-patches distutils a bit like setuptools does, to get hold of information
typically declared in setup.py as kwargs to setup().

Usage:
    dh_virtualenv_helper setup.py generate
'''

import distutils.core
import sys


def generate(**kwargs):
    print kwargs


assert sys.argv[2] == 'generate'

distutils.core.setup = generate

execfile(sys.argv[1])
